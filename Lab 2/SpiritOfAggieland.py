#Outputs the Spirit of Aggieland spaced correctly
#stores the song in a string
song = '''
Some may boast of prowess bold
Of the school they think so grand
But there's a spirit can ne'er be told
It's the Spirit of Aggieland
We are the Aggies, the aggies are we
True to each other as Aggies can be
We've got to fight boys
We've got to fight!
We've got to fight for Maroon and White
After they've boosted all the rest
Then they will come and join the best
For we are the Aggies, the Aggies are we
We're from Texas AMC
T-E-X-A-S
A-G-G-I-E
Fight! Fight! Fight-fight-fight!
Fight, Maroon! And White-white-white!
A-G-G-I-E
Texas! Texas! A-M-C
Gig 'em! Aggies! 1-2-3!
Farmers fight! Farmers fight!
Fight! Fight!
Farmers, farmers, fight!'''
