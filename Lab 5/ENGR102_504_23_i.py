'''This program calculates a fibonnaci sequence between 0 and 500'''
#The Fibonnaci sequence must start with the two values, 0 and 1
#Create the two variables(i1 and i2) for the values needed for the Fibonnaci calculation
#Use a while loop that is true when i2 <= 500
    #print i1
    #print i2
    #print i1 + i2
    #set i2 equals to i1 + i2
